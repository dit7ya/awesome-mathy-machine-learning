Are you frustrated that introductory *Machine Learning* courses just aren't math-heavy, or even rigorous enough? Are you very irritated all the interesting papers with deep theoretical results just don't get the attention they deserve?
Are you looking for juicy rigorous and elegant math heavy content related to Machine Learning?

Well, you have come to the right place.
